Energy, Obsession, and Determination (or maybe Deliberation) come through the pages that are written in this book. Grant Cardone gives advice by telling of habits that he has and recommends which he believes helped him be successful. 

The book seems to be a hybrid of a secret cookbook for making money, a sales pitch, and a book of proverbs to motivate. Cardone doesn't just give advice for running a business and organization so much as he does provide practical habits and attitudes for achieving success.

As a first-time reader of Grant Cardone, the book showed some tactics and philosophies that some might call extreme, but the story of how Grant became so successful might also hit close to home.
