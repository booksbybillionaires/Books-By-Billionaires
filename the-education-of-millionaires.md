This book is about how to succeed in life like many millionaires and billionaires do. Stories about not just success in making a fortune in life, but how determined individuals leveraged their resources to accomplish their goals.

A core message is that college is generally a rip off. Formal Education in The U.S. teaches people to be discontent worker drones, not successful masters of their own destinies. This has always been obvious to me personally, but Micheal Ellsberg shares knowledge of the necessary skills needed to be successful and gives info about how to develop and use those skills. Further study and application of Vital skills is necessary, of course, so Micheal Gives many titles of books he recommends for further study

Reading "The Education of Millionaires" is probably my top recommendation to any high school student that hasn't figured this stuff out yet. Or pretty much every public school student. Or maybe everyone should read this book.
