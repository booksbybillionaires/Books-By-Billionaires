### Apr. 23, 2018. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell (Audio)

"Outliers" is a series of obscure life stories of non-obscure, successful people, showing how luck played a role in their success.

The book is written in a journalist story-telling style. Malcolm Gladwell shows an interesting kind of intelligence in writing this way. The thesis of the book seems to be something that I already knew, but the stories were interesting enough to keep me from taking my earphones out of my ears.

The delivery of the messages are what most interest me. I would like to learn how to speak more like the author of this book, because it was interesting to me and other's that have personally recommended him.
