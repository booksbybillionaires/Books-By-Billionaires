### Dec. 18, 2019. The 5 Essential People Skills by Dale Carnegie Training

Assertiveness is defined in this book: don't be aggressive, but be assertive. How to do this is described in one of the chapters.

This read is great for people who aren't salesmen for their dayjob. The things talked about are useful in the workplace but not common sense for most people, which is believable when you consider the popular saying that common sense isn't all that common.

This has great re-read value, to me at least, not only because I didn't fully understand it the first read through but also because there are given in the book ways to practice the skills that are talked about.
