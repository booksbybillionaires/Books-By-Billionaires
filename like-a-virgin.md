### Nov. 26, 2019. Like A Virgin by Richard Branson

As with his other book "The Virgin Way", Branson's energy shows in this read. The book focuses on lifestyle habits and advice on how to start a grow a business. The subtitle of this book is "Secrets They Won't Teach You At Business School", and It's clear to me that reading books like this that give down-to-earth advice is probably of equal if not greater value than the curriculum of an MBA degree.

Even with around 330 pages and there being several Branson books I have not read, the book still left me wishing it was longer.
