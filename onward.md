### Nov. 28, 2019. Onward by Howard Schultz

With Joanne Gordon, Howard Schultz has put his style into this book. It was a difficult read for me compared to other books, maybe because of the extreme descriptiveness and almost wordiness of all the corporate stories and descriptions of the emotions that backed them.

Like Richard Branson's books, this is full of little stories but it seems to follow some sort of timeline. Reading the book kind of shows to be like the Starbucks experience itself: sophisticated and rich.
