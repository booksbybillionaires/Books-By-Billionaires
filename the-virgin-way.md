### Nov. 30, 2017. The Virgin Way by Richard Branson

This book full of Richard Branson's philosophy on life, and for Richard Branson this mostly means philosophy of business. Being the first book by billionaires I ever read, I noticed the high amount of storytelling done while writing the book. Branson illustrates his energy and attitudes through stories of many failures, and some big successes.

Every time I read this book for even a minute I came away feeling some of Richard Branson's carefree optimism, feeling like conquering life and living in high in the clouds was only a distance away, but of course required a lot of work and ingenuity to get there.
