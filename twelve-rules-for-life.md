Most people can probably benefit from reading/listening to this book.

Jordan Pederson not only says things that need to be said about life and the world, he speaks it well. The book is not only a psychology, even philosophy book but also poetry.

This book was a must-read. I found myself rewinding by 30 seconds many times throughout. At night, when I listened before bed, It was diffucult for me to stop listening and be responsible and get some sleep. I will definitely be listening again, and maybe even buying the book to read and support Jordan Pederson.
