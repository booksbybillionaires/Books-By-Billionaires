### Nov 9, 2019. How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie

This book was enjoyable, not in the way a captivating fiction book is enjoyable. The book was more of a pat on the back, a few words of encouragement in a couple hundred pages.

Blending statistics about worry with stories supporting the writer's point, this book definitely contains material that the modern education system is lacking (at least in America it is). I wish I had read this in middle school.
